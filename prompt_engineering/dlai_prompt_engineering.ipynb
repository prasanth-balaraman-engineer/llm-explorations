            "Resilience is the ability to bounce back from difficult situations or setbacks. It's an important trait to have because life is full of challenges and obstacles. Resilient people are able to adapt to change, stay positive, and keep moving forward even when things get tough. Building resilience takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. Some ways to develop resilience include practicing self-care, seeking support from others, and learning from past experiences. Remember, resilience is not about being invincible or never experiencing hardship, but rather about being able to overcome adversity and come out stronger on the other side.\n"
